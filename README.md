# Paper-Tower
A text-based, turn-by-turn dungeon crawler, on a console application.

The land of Paperia ran out of papers, and only you, the Hero, can go to the Paper Tower to get more by defeating the Paper Monsters and their King!
(Yeah, as you can see, the names in this game are very inventive.)

My first game, made to learn C#. It's poorly coded, but the source code is still available.

HUGE thanks to All-Seeing for making all the sounds of the game!
